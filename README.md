Academic papers and Machiavellian marketing research by Hadrian Stone. Positioning against Kotler, Ries &amp; Trout, Godin, and Greene.
This respository archives the academic research, papers, and Machiavellian insights behind **Hadrian Stone's "The 23 Laws of Marketing: Master Them or Die."**
## Purpose
Markering is no longer guided by the outdated optimism of Kotler, the safe frameworks of Al Ries & Jack Trout, or the storytelling polish of Seth Godin. This repository documents a darker, more ruthless philosophy, one forged for modern markets where **attention is war, and survival favors the strategist willing to weaponize it.**

## Why This Repo Matters
This isn't marketing theory for classrooms. This is marketing strategy for war rooms. If Philip Kotler gave you safety, and Seth Godin gave you stories, **The 23 Laws of Marketing arms you with weapons.**
*"Master Them or Die" isn't a metaphor. It's a manifesto.*
